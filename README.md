## What is this?

This template bot was for a project for the fraughtian community where developers how are new to programming can look through the code and see how it works or programmers who dosen't feel like making the command handler, messages the really boring stuff and just jump into coding your first or next discord bot

## Why is it Good For Beginners?

What makes this repository good for beginners is when they look at the code assuming they know JS they can understand how it works when they read the provided comment above the line I tried my best to comment the most for it, it comes packed with a Command Handler, Event Handler and it's setup to the point where you can just add your commands and events

## How do I get started?

In order to get started go ahead and download this repository to your local machine. To do that you can click the button in this repository that says "clone" and then press "Download zip" or you can open your terminal and do 
```
git clone https://github.com/DeveloperVulpo/DiscordJS-Template.git
```

Once you have this repository on your local machin you can extract it (if you downloaded it with the download zip option) and then you'll be greeted with a file called "config.json", this is where the setting will go for your bot. To get the token go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and you can set the prefix to what you prefer. I recommend sticking with something other than "!" or "?" as many bots uses them and there will conflicts with other bots but instead get the first name of you bot's name and add an exclaimation mark after it. For example "G!" or "B!".
